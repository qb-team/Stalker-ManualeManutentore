# 5.3 OpenAPI

## 5.3.1 What is OpenAPI?
The OpenAPI Specification is a standard developed for creating *contract-first* RESTful APIs in a standard way, which should make easier the comprehension of the APIs by users and developers developing a client for an API. It was first developed by a company called [SmartBear](https://smartbear.com/) which released the Swagger 2.0 specification (Swagger was the previous name for OpenAPI). Now this specification is released under version 3.0.* with the name OpenAPI 3.0.*, since it became fully open source.

*qbteam* relied on **OpenAPI Specification v3.0.0** for *Stalker*.

## 5.3.2 Why OpenAPI?
*qbteam* has chosen OpenAPI for developing the *Stalker* API because it wanted to follow standard and well-known ways to develop its API, as it was its first time developing one.

Furthermore, the code generation tools available in the [Swagger website](https://swagger.io) first, and later the tools from [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/), made the design and development process much easier and coherent between all the platforms the team needed to develop on.
